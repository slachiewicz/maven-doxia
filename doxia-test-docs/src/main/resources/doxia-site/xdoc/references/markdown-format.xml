    <section name="The Markdown format">

      <subsection name="Overview">

        <p>
          Markdown is a popular lightweight markup language, easy to read and easy to write.
          It is supported by a large panel of websites, text editors/IDEs and converter tools.
          Markdown format is supported both as source (parser) and destination (sink).
        </p>

        <p>
          The Markdown parser uses the <a href="https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java">flexmark-java</a>
          library to convert Markdown to HTML, which is then parsed into Doxia Sink API method calls.
        </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Limitations">

        <p>
          Due to the nature of Markdown and the Sink API abstractions, the following limitations apply
          to the Markdown sink (output generation):
        </p>

        <h4>Anchors</h4>
        <p>
          Markdown does not natively support anchors. The Markdown sink emits HTML anchor tags
          (<code>&lt;a id="..."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>) to support this Sink API feature.
        </p>

        <h4>Figures</h4>
        <p>
          While the Markdown sink supports basic figure output via standard Markdown image syntax
          (<code>![alt text](image.png)</code>), it does not support figure captions in native Markdown.
          Full figure support with captions requires HTML markup.
        </p>

        <h4>Table Justification</h4>
        <p>
          The Markdown sink supports basic table column justification (left, center, right) using
          extended Markdown table syntax. However, the <code>grid</code> flag for table formatting
          is not supported in Markdown output.
        </p>

        <h4>Table Captions</h4>
        <p>
          Table captions are not supported in standard Markdown. The Markdown sink ignores table
          captions as there is no suitable location to emit them, even using HTML markup.
        </p>

        <h4>Page Breaks</h4>
        <p>
          Page breaks are not supported in Markdown output. The Markdown sink ignores page break
          events as they have no meaningful representation in Markdown.
        </p>

        <h4>Links in Code Blocks</h4>
        <p>
          Links inside code blocks are not supported and will be ignored by the Markdown sink.
        </p>
