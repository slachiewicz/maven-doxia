    <section name="The APT format">

      <subsection name="Overview">

        <p>
          APT stands for "Almost Plain Text". It is a wiki-like format that allows you to write
          simple, structured documents with minimal formatting markup. APT was designed to be
          easy to read in its source format.
        </p>

        <p>
          The APT format is supported both as source (parser) and destination (sink).
        </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Limitations">

        <p>
          Due to the nature of APT and the Sink API abstractions, the following limitations apply
          to the APT sink (output generation):
        </p>

        <h4>Section Title Levels</h4>
        <p>
          APT supports section title levels 1 through 5. If a deeper nesting level (greater than 5)
          is requested via the Sink API, the APT sink will replace it with level 5 and emit a warning.
        </p>
